#Simple IIIF Service and Manifest

## Simple IIIF Service

A minimum IIIF service for JPEG pictures without predefined tiles. Because all tiles are generated on the fly, the performance will not be efficient as a large scale public service. Maybe useful for local testing purpose.

- define IMG_ROOT (relative path to JPEG image directory)
- prepare manifest file where service@id is set like
  "@id": "http://example.org/{path to this script}/{image path from IMG_ROOT}",
- the above manifest can be generated by the acompanying manifest-generator.php


## A Manifest Generator

generates an IIIF manifest for acompanying iiif-simple.php.

- looks up IMG_ROOT defined in iiif-simple.php, this scipt generates image resource objects for all JPEG images in IMG_ROOT, with servuce@id set to appropriate iiif-simple.php service URIs.
- If change the image dir path with a form, IMG_ROOT should be changed accordingly.
